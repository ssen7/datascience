## This is for the Coursera Data Science Specialization

### This is my attempt at solving the Coursera Programming Assignments for the Data Science Specialiazation.

### All of the scripts here output results as outlined in the assignments and have helped me score 100% in all my assignments.

### I hope to keep it that way. :)

# NOTE:
* Please extract the data in the same directory as the scripts. Happy coding.
* The code is not optimized, but works. Any suggestions are welcome.
